Environmental justice analysis of gas leaks across Massachusetts
These are the data files, R code, and markdown documents used to perform analyses and produce a PDF report of the environmental justice dimensions of gas leaks in Massachusetts. The file "An Environmental Justice Analysis of Gas Leaks2.Rmd" is the final markdown document used to prodce the PDF report submitted for publication. To knit this document to a PDF, all of the RDS files must be in the correct relative path.

Other R code documents contain code for intermediate data creation and analyses. Data for those documents is not provided here, but derives from the American Community Survey (via the `tidycensus` and `tigris` packages in R) and from gas leaks data provided by HEET (https://heet.org/).

# Abstract {-}
A growing body of research shows that natural gas leaks at the distribution level are much more common and extensive than previously thought. Although scholars and advocates have raised alarms about the climate change and economic significance of these leaks, there has been little consideration of the problem from an environmental justice perspective. Using recently available high resolution leak data, this analysis of natural gas leaks across the state of Massachusetts shows that People of Color, limited English speaking households, and renters are disproportionately exposed to natural gas leaks, as compared to the general population, to White residents, and to homeowners. This pattern is evident for all leaks in the state, for leaks disaggregated by leak class or grade, and for leaks disaggregated by utility. This analysis shows that natural gas leaks are an environmental justice issue warranting further study and policy attention.

In calendar year 2019, there were 27,124 natural gas leaks in the distribution system reported by seven of the eight investor-owned utilities in Massachusetts that filed leak reports with the state Department of Public Utilities. Repairs were reported for 11,399 (42%) of these, leaving 15,725 (58%) unrepaired leaks across the state as of December 31, 2019.

Reported gas leaks were nearly ubiquitous across the state. Over 87% of Census Block Groups within the gas utility territories had at least one known gas leak in 2019, and approximately 75% had at least one unrepaired gas leak at the end of 2019. There was significant variation in geographic distribution and concentration of these leaks.

The number of leaks in any one Block Group ranged from 0 to 41, with a strong positive skew. Half of all Block Groups (2,097) had fewer than four leaks. The vast majority of all leaks were located in the eastern half of the state, particularly in the greater Boston region, where most of the population resides. Moreover, most of these leaks (65%) occurred within the service territory of National Grid, which is the largest natural gas utility in the state, serving Boston and surrounding communities.

MAYBE SHOW TABLE WITH TOTAL LEAK DENSITIES BY SCALE RATHER THAN BREAKING OUT BY UNREPAIRED VS REPAIRED LEAKS???

Leaks were concentrated in and around the more populous urban areas. Leak densities for Census Block Groups ranged from 0 to 245 leaks per square kilometer, again with a strong positive skew. Half of Block Groups had less than 2.2 leaks per square kilometer. The geographic pattern of leak density - highest in the eastern half of the state and around populous urban centers - was unaffected by the unit of analysis, exhibiting the same geographic pattern from Block Group to County Subdivision levels.

## Response – Leak Repair
Another way to evaluate the equity of natural gas leaks is to consider how responses to those leaks varies. This section considers two measures of leak response: 

* the time to repair leaks that were repaired in 2019, and 
* the age of leaks that remained unrepaired at the end of the 2019 reporting year. 


### Time to repair
In 2019, repairs were reported for 11,399 leaks (42% of all reported leaks) across the state. Most of the leaks repaired were Class 1 leaks (53%), which is understandable since Class 1 leaks are the most hazardous and are supposed to be repaired immediately. Class 2 leaks were 39% of leaks repaired, followed distantly by Class 3 leaks, which constituted only 8% of all repaired leaks in 2019. Repair time for these leaks was calculated as the duration of time from the date and time the leak was reported to the date and time of its reported repair. Repair times are reported as the number of days between reporting and repair. Time to repair varied dramatically both within and between leak classes and across utilities. While 73% (4,440) of Class 1 leaks were repaired in less than one day, eight were more than one year old, and at least one leak was over five years old when it was repaired. Note that Fitchburg Gas/Unitil did not report repair data by leak class.
